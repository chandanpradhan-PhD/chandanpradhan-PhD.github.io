My research interest is focused on understanding the impact of anthropogenic disturbances on fluvial systems. I am also studying quantitative fluvial geomorphology with hydrodynamic modelling, fluvial data analysis, and integration of the GIS dataset. 

## My research interests are:

* River Hydraulics
* Fluvial Geomorphology
* Stream Health Management
* Eco-hydraulics
* Applications of Geospatial Techniques in Water Resources
