I completed my Ph.D. in the Department of Civil Engineering, IITG in 2022. My dissertation titled “Study of the Process-form Relationships in Continuum of Braided Channel Patterns” focused on understanding the braided rivers, which are governed by complex, unstable river networks formed due to the interaction of high flow energy and intense sediment transport. The generation of complex morphological adjustments over a braided corridor is a response to the changes in flow and sediment supply. Understanding the braided river behavior and underlying concepts through field-based studies, modeling, analysis and cloud computing is beneficial for their effective management. I proposed an effective discharge integrated stream power curve, which accurately predicts the channel transition (from sinuous to weakly braided) in regulated river. In addition, I used the concepts of recovery and resilience and developed process-based indicators to capture fluvial system state trajectory and design management approaches. My research demonstrated the presence of instream vegetation as an additional degree of freedom, which further governs the energy dissipation processes in braided river settings. My analysis revealed that integration of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform with limited hydro-morphological dataset can provide a basis for understanding the complex process-form relationships in braided rivers.
