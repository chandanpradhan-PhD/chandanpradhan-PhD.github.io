I completed my Ph.D. in the Department of Civil Engineering, IITG in 2022. My dissertation titled “Study of the Process-form Relationships in Continuum of Braided Channel Patterns” focused on understanding the braided rivers, which are governed by complex, unstable river networks formed due to the interaction of high flow energy and intense sediment transport. The generation of complex morphological adjustments over a braided corridor is a response to the changes in flow and sediment supply. Understanding the braided river behavior and underlying concepts through field-based studies, modeling, analysis and cloud computing is beneficial for their effective management. I proposed an effective discharge integrated stream power curve, which accurately predicts the channel transition (from sinuous to weakly braided) in regulated river. In addition, I used the concepts of recovery and resilience and developed process-based indicators to capture fluvial system state trajectory and design management approaches. My research demonstrated the presence of instream vegetation as an additional degree of freedom, which further governs the energy dissipation processes in braided river settings. My analysis revealed that integration of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform with limited hydro-morphological dataset can provide a basis for understanding the complex process-form relationships in braided rivers.

**Publication 1**: [*A process‑based recovery indicator for anthropogenically disturbed river system*](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1038/s41598-022-14542-x.pdf)

| Key Findings     | Highlights |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Utilization of Entropy Theory and Cloud Computing   | The study employs entropy theory and Google Earth Engine cloud computing to analyze the state and recovery potential of two large sub-basins of the Mahanadi River in India, with particular focus on post-monsoon season dynamics|
| Novel Assessment Indicators   | The paper introduces a normalized river recovery indicator (NRRI) and cross-sectional intensity entropy (CIE) as methods to assess temporal changes in river health, and to identify system dynamics and evolutionary adjustments |
| Instream Vegetation and Energy Dissipation	|  The research underlines the critical role of instream vegetation in controlling the hierarchy of energy dissipation and shaping the morphological continuum in the macrochannel settings, potentially steering the river recovery trajectory |

**Publication 2**: [*Role of effective discharge on morphological changes for a regulated macrochannel river system*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X21001264)

| Key Findings     | Highlights |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Role of Effective Discharge   | The study examines the crucial role of effective discharge in the transport of suspended sediment in a regulated macrochannel river system, specifically the Brahmani River in India, and its influence on landscape modification and river restoration|
| Impact of Dam Construction   | The research reveals the significant alteration in the natural flow-sediment regime and channel pattern of the Brahmani River due to the construction of the Rengali dam, leading to a notable reduction in effective discharge |
| Insights on River Morphology and Energy Dissipation	|  The paper formulates an effective discharge integrated stream power curve that accurately predicts channel transition in the post-dam period. The proposed probability of braiding further illuminates the hierarchy of energy dissipation and the morphological continuum in the Brahmani River |

**Publication 3**: [*Regulated rivers in India: research progress and future directions*](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09715010.2021.1975319)

| Key Findings     | Highlights |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Impact of Large Dams   | The paper discusses how large dams impose an artificial flow-sediment regime that results in significant alterations to channel forms and riverine habitats, with a particular focus on the situation in India|
| Need for Interdisciplinary Approach   | It stresses the need for interdisciplinary multifaceted approaches to understand and predict channel behavior in complex relaxation paths along regulated rivers in India, given that current understanding is still in its preliminary stages |
| Conceptual Frameworks and Future Directions	|  The article concludes by proposing new conceptual frameworks and research directions concerning the implications of channel-forming discharge and river recovery potential in the Himalayan and peninsular rivers |
