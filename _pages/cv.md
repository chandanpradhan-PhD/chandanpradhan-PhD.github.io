## Work Experience

* Post Doctoral Fellow (Civi), TIH-TIDF, IIT Guwahati (December 2022- Continuing) 

Work Component: 
To understand the complex processes in the Brahmaputra River system and explore the bio-morphological responses with underwater robotics and sensors. My responsibilities are to develop a low-cost real-time physical perimeter monitoring systems for the wetlands connected to the Brahmaputra River. Further, it extends to create a cloud database for accessing the health of wetlands and associated productivity to identify the vulnerable classes (critical risk indicators) for enhanced catchment water management and improved action plans.
