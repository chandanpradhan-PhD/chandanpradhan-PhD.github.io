I am, Chandan Pradhan, a PhD student in the Department of Civil Engineering, IIT Guwahati currently working on River Processes and Form. I obtained my master's degree in water resource engineering from the Department of Civil Engineering, IIT Guwahati in 2016. My research interest is focused on the impact of anthropogenic disturbances on fluvial systems. I am also studying quantitative fluvial geomorphology with hydrodynamic modelling, fluvial data analysis, and integration of the GIS dataset.
