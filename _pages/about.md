## About me

Welcome! I am a Research Scholar in the [Department of Civil Engineering](https://iitg.ac.in/civil/site) of  [Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee](https://iitg.ac.in/).  

I have a B.Tech. (Bachelor of Technology) degree in Civil Engineering from [IGIT Sarang](https://igitsarang.ac.in/) and a M.Tech. (Master of Technology) degree in Water Resources Engineering and Management from [IIT Guwahati (https://iitg.ac.in/). During my Ph.D. at IIT Guwahati, I am working on impact of anthropogenic disturbances on fluvial systems. I am also studying quantitative fluvial geomorphology with hydrodynamic modelling, fluvial data analysis, and integration of the GIS dataset.
