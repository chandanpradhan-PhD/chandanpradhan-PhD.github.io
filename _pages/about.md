## About me

Welcome! I am a Post-Doctoral Fellow (Civil) in the [Technology Innovation Hub- TIDF/NM-ICPS](https://iitg.ac.in/tihue/) of [Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati](https://iitg.ac.in/).  

I have a B.Tech. (Bachelor of Technology) degree in Civil Engineering from [IGIT Sarang](https://igitsarang.ac.in/) and a M.Tech. (Master of Technology) degree in Water Resources Engineering and Management from [IIT Guwahati](https://iitg.ac.in/). In my Ph.D. at IIT Guwahati, I have worked on impact of anthropogenic disturbances on fluvial systems. I am also studying the quantitative fluvial geomorphology with hydrodynamic modelling, fluvial data analysis, and remote sensing based tools/ cloud computing platforms.
