## About me

Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Water Resources and Ocean Engineering](https://appmech.nitk.ac.in/)) of [National Institute of Technology, Surathkal](https://www.nitk.ac.in/)).  

I have a B.Tech. (Bachelor of Technology) degree in Civil Engineering from [IGIT Sarang](https://igitsarang.ac.in/) and a M.Tech. (Master of Technology) degree in Water Resources Engineering and Management from [IIT Guwahati](https://iitg.ac.in/). In my Ph.D. at IIT Guwahati, I have worked on impact of anthropogenic disturbances on fluvial systems. I am also studying the quantitative fluvial geomorphology with hydrodynamic modelling, fluvial data analysis, and remote sensing based tools/ cloud computing platforms.
